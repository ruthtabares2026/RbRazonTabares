      <li>Lesbian is the first term out of all the letters in the acronym LGBTQ to come into existence. For centuries, the word had been associated with the works of Sappho, an ancient Greek poet from the island of Lesbos who wrote poems about same-gender love.</li>
      <li>In the late 1960s, activists reclaimed a decades-old slur, “gay.” Throughout the 20th century, homosexual activity was largely outlawed, and slurs that attacked LGBTQ+ people were common.</li>
    <li>Transgender: The earliest found usage of the term to is from a 1965 psychology textbook, and it was popularized by activists like Virginia Prince. It replaced other terms that were derogatory to transgender people and became a common term by the 2000s.</li>

      <li>Alan Turing is celebrated today for cracking the Enigma code, which is thought to have shortened World War 2 by several years. Despite this major accomplishment, he was later arrested in 1952 because homosexuality was illegal in Britain during the mid-20th century. In 2017, the government agreed to officially pardon men who were convicted because of their sexuality. The pardoning is now known as the Alan Turing law.</li>

<li>Marsha P. Johnson was an African American transgender-rights activist who had a huge impact on the LGBTQ+ community. In June 1969, police raided The Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York. Marsha stood up to the police during the raids and led protests and riots, demanding rights for gay people. These riots served as a catalyst for activism and inspired others around the world to fight for equality.</li>

<li>Allan Horsfall played a huge role in removing the stigma of criminality from homosexuality. In 1964, he and a group of friends set up the North West Homosexual Law Reform Committee which worked to decriminalize homosexuality. This later transformed into the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, the largest LGBTQ+ organisation there has ever been in the UK, with more than 5,000 members and 120 local groups at it’s largest.</li>

      <li>During the Spanish colonization, patriarchy and the machismo concept were introduced to the Philippines, causing feminine men and crossdressers to be looked down upon. The American colonization only reinforced this with Western concepts of gender and sexuality.</li>

<li>The first LGBT Pride March in the Philippines was on June 26, 1994 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall Riot. The march was not only the first pride march in the Philippines, but in all of Asia.</li>

<li>The Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP) released the LGBT Non-discrimination Policy Resolution last October 2011. This was in response to overwhelming complaints against a certified psychologist who recommended conversion therapy for children who come out as gay or lesbian. This policy statement affirmed the equality of LGBTQ+ people as well as the right to not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and gender identity</li>
