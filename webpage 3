          <li>During the Spanish colonization, patriarchy and the machismo concept were introduced to the Philippines, causing feminine men and crossdressers to be looked down upon. The American colonization only reinforced this with Western concepts of gender and sexuality.</li>
          <li>The first LGBT Pride March in the Philippines was on June 26, 1994 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall Riot. The march was not only the first pride march in the Philippines, but in all of Asia.</li>
          <li>The Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP) released the LGBT Non-discrimination Policy Resolution last October 2011. This was in response to overwhelming complaints against a certified psychologist who recommended conversion therapy for children who come out as gay or lesbian. This policy statement affirmed the equality of LGBTQ+ people as well as the right to not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and gender identity</li>

          <li>The God of Death, Sidapa, lived alone in Mt. Madjaas. He could see the seven moon gods, and he fell in love with them. He showered them with love and gifts like asking birds and mermaids to praise the moons and asked fireflies to light a path to the sky. One of the moon gods, Libulan, came down on the firefly path to meet Sidapa. But Bakunawa, the sea dragon, who was also infatuated with the moons, grew furious. Sidapa saw it attacking and saved Libulan. Afterwards, they reside as husbands on Mt. Madjaas. Some Filipinos use Libulan as a symbol and refer to him as the patron god of homosexuality.</li>
          <li>Lakapati (or Ikapati) is the goddess of fertility and good harvest. She was also described as an androgynous, intersex, or transgender goddess. According to myth, she was one of the kindest deities, giving man the gift of agriculture. Pre-colonial Filipinos would offer sacrifices to her before planting a new field.</li>
