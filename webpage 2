<h1>The Discrimination the LGBTQ+ Community Faces</h1>

<p>The LGBTQ+ community faces a lot of discrimination. People discriminate them because they say that "it's against their religion", "it's disgusting", "it's unnatural", and many other excuses for being judgemental. Not only do they have to face discrimination everyday, but they also get less access to the bare human necessities. These include having less access to some medical care or health care, not allowing to enter some places due to discrimination.</p>

<h1>How we can help out</h1>

<p>There are various things that we can do to help out. There are various things that we can do, a few examples are as follows:</br>
<div>Create and Protect Safe Spaces</div></br>
- The people of the LGBTQ+ community still face many real dangers for being open about their sexuality. We can create safe spaces by creating actual physical spaces or making an inclusive environment in everyday places.</br>
</br><div>Advocate for Legal Changes</div></br>
- Spreading the word won't be enough. Advocating or publicly supporting Legal Chanes that can benefit the LGBTQ+ community can make better changes.</br>
</br><div>Do Not Let Slurs Slide</div></br>
- Language is what we use to have a conversation with others. It's how we define ourselves and the world around us. But language can also be used to insult other people or bring other people down. Not letting slurs slide can positively affect a lot of people especially the LGBTQ+ community. Informing other people about not using slurs not only benefit the LGBTQ+ community but also benefit them since they are informed on which is wrong and which is right.</p>
