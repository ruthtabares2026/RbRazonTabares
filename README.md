Project Proposal 

Some people everyday experience inequality and violence such as torture or even execution because people discriminate against them for who they love or who they are. Sexual orientation and gender identity are aspects of ourselves that sould not lead to discrimination and violence towards anyone. There have been major changes in laws in other places surrounding the issues of same-sex marriage and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, though the opinion and acceptance of homosexuality still remains divided around the world. This website will walk you through this topic as well as show you examples in order for you to get an idea and be informed of this topic.
