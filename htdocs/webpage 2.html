    <h1>The Discrimination the LGBTQ+ Community Faces</h1>

    <p>The LGBTQ+ community faces a lot of discrimination. People discriminate them because they say that "it's against
      their religion", "it's disgusting", "it's unnatural", and many other excuses for being judgemental. Not only do
      they
      have to face discrimination everyday, but they also get less access to the bare human necessities. These include
      having less access to some medical care or health care, not allowing to enter some places due to discrimination.
    </p>

    <h1>How we can help out</h1>

    <p>There are various things that we can do to help out. There are various things that we can do, a few examples are
      as
      follows:</br>
    <div>Create and Protect Safe Spaces</div></br>
    - The people of the LGBTQ+ community still face many real dangers for being open about their sexuality. We can
    create
    safe spaces by creating actual physical spaces or making an inclusive environment in everyday places.</br>
    </br>
    <div>Advocate for Legal Changes</div></br>
    - Spreading the word won't be enough. Advocating or publicly supporting Legal Changes in laws or in the community in
    general that can benefit the LGBTQ+ community can make better changes.</br>
    </br>
    <div>Do Not Let Slurs Slide</div></br>
    - Language is what we use to have a conversation with others. It's how we define ourselves and the world around us.
    But language can also be used to insult other people or bring other people down. Not letting slurs slide can
    positively affect a lot of people especially the LGBTQ+ community. Informing other people about not using slurs not
    only benefit the LGBTQ+ community but also benefit them since they are informed on which is wrong and which is
    right.</br>
    </br>
    <div>Do Not Make Assumptions about Anyone Else's Sexuality</div></br>
    - Assuming what someone else's gender identity or sexual orientation can, obviously, lead to many misunderstandings.
    No matter anyone's gender identity, our physical body and clothing should never dictate who we are as a person or
    how
    we are supposed to be addressed.</br>
    </br>
    <div>Support Your Family and Friends Who Question Their Sexuality or Identify as LGBTQ+</div></br>
    - If a friend or family member has come out to you, it is likely that it took a lot of strength for them to come
    out.
    Them having your support is one of the best ways for you to help out not only your friends and family, but also the
    LGBTQ+ community.</br>
    </br>
    <div>Do Not Try To Change Their Sexuality</div></br>
    - A lot people go through a long process of figuring out their sexuality or gender identity. While it may be a bit
    confusing for some people to understand this, an important thing to understand is that these traits are a part of a
    person's identity and can no longer be changed.</p>
