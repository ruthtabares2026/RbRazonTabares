        Alan Turing is celebrated today for cracking the Enigma code, which is thought to have shortened World War 2 by
        several years. He was also arrested in 1952 because homosexuality was illegal in Britain during the mid-20th
        century. In 2017, the government agreed to officially pardon men who were convicted because of their sexuality.
        The pardoning is now known as the Alan Turing law.

        Marsha P. Johnson was an African American transgender-rights activist who had a huge impact on the LGBTQ+
        community. In June 1969, police raided The Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York. Marsha stood up to the police
        during the raids and led protests and riots, demanding rights for gay people. These riots served as a catalyst
        for
        activism and inspired others around the world to fight for equality.
        <br>
        Allan Horsfall played a huge role in removing the stigma of criminality from homosexuality. In 1964, he and a
        group of friends set up the North West Homosexual Law Reform Committee which worked to decriminalize
        homosexuality. This later transformed into the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, the largest LGBTQ+ organisation
        there has ever been in the UK, with more than 5,000 members and 120 local groups at it’s largest.

        <h2>History in the Philippines</h2>
        During the Spanish colonization, patriarchy and the machismo concept were introduced to the Philippines, causing
        feminine men and crossdressers to be looked down upon. The American colonization only reinforced this with
        Western
        concepts of gender and sexuality.
        <br>
        The first LGBT Pride March in the Philippines was on June 26, 1994 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
        Stonewall Riot. The march was not only the first pride march in the Philippines, but in all of Asia.
        <br>
        The Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP) released the LGBT Non-discrimination Policy Resolution
        last
        October 2011. This was in response to overwhelming complaints against a certified psychologist who recommended
        conversion therapy for children who come out as gay or lesbian. This policy statement affirmed the equality of
        LGBTQ+ people as well as the right to not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and gender
        identity

        <h2>Filipino Myths</h2>
        The God of Death, Sidapa, lived alone in Mt. Madjaas. He could see the seven moon gods, and he fell in love with
        them. He showered them with love and gifts like asking birds and mermaids to praise the moons and asked
        fireflies
        to light a path to the sky. One of the moon gods, Libulan, came down on the firefly path to meet Sidapa. But
        Bakunawa, the sea dragon, who was also infatuated with the moons, grew furious. Sidapa saw it attacking and
        saved
        Libulan. Afterwards, they reside as husbands on Mt. Madjaas. Some Filipinos use Libulan as a symbol and refer to
        him as the patron god of homosexuality.
        <br>
        Lakapati (or Ikapati) is the goddess of fertility and good harvest. She was also described as an androgynous,
        intersex, or transgender goddess. According to myth, she was one of the kindest deities, giving man the gift of
        agriculture. Pre-colonial Filipinos would offer sacrifices to her before planting a new field.

        <h2>Popularization of terms</h2>
        Lesbian is the first term out of all the letters in the acronym LGBTQ to come into existence. For centuries, the
        word had been associated with the works of Sappho, an ancient Greek poet from the island of Lesbos who wrote
        poems
        about women.
        <br>
        In the late 1960s, activists reclaimed a decades-old slur, “gay.” Throughout the 20th century, same-gender
        attraction and sexual activity was largely outlawed, and this and other slurs that denigrated LGBTQ+ people were
        common.
        <br>
        Transgender: The earliest found usage of the term to is from a 1965 psychology textbook, and it was popularized
        by
        activists like Virginia Prince. It replaced other terms that were derogatory to transgender people and became a
        common term by the 2000s.
